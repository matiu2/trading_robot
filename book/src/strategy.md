# Strategy

## Overview

We'll be using Renko with a ATR(14) brick size.

We'll use higher high, lower low to determine the market **direction**.

We'll use Trend Strategy to trigger the market entry and exit.

When a candle closes, crossing the trend strategy in the correct direction we'll enter a trade.

When a candle closes crossing back over the trent strategy line, we'll exit the trade.
